# Franka Emika Robot with SAC+HER

## Overview:
This project trains the franka emika robot using SAC + HER algorithm.

## Overview of algorithm:
- Humans have the ability to learn as much from achieving an undesired outcome as from the desired one.
- HER allows the algorithm to perform exactly this kind of reasoning and can be combined with any off-policy RL algorithm.
- The idea behind HER is to replay each episode with a different goal than the one the agent was trying to achieve.
